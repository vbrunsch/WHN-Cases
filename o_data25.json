COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus that targets not only the lungs but also the cardiovascular system. COVID-19 can manifest with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild symptoms to severe forms of the disease, characterized by respiratory failure due to severe alveolar damage. Several studies investigated the underlying mechanisms of the severe lung damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed that the respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is the consequence not only of acute respiratory distress syndrome but also of macro- and microvascular involvement. New observations show that COVID-19 is an endothelial disease, and the consequent endotheliopathy is responsible for inflammation, cytokine storm, oxidative stress, and coagulopathy. In this review, we show the central role of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the COVID-19 pathogenesis and present the therapeutic targets deriving from this endotheliopathy.","assigned_subjects1":"Inflammation | Stress | COVID-19 | COVID-19 | deaths | COVID-19 | SARS-CoV-2 | COVID-19 | respiratory failure | alveolar damage | SARS-CoV-2 infection | respiratory failure | COVID-19 | acute respiratory distress syndrome | COVID-19 | inflammation | coagulopathy | endothelial dysfunction | inflammation | COVID-19 |Inflammation | Psychological Distress | | Death | | Respiratory Insufficiency | Lung Injury | Respiratory Distress Syndrome | Blood Coagulation Disorders |"},{"pmid":"34341436","title_e":"A cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging-based pilot study to assess coronary microvascular disease in COVID-19 patients.","authors":"Drakos S, Chatzantonis G, Bietenbeck M, Evers G, Schulze AB, Mohr M, Fonfara H, Meier C, Yilmaz A, ","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is primarily characterised by a respiratory disease.

Interestingly, up to 50% of patients suffer from persistent exercise dyspnoea and a post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) after having overcome an acute COVID-19 infection. In the present study, we assessed the presence of coronary microvascular disease (CMD) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in post-COVID-19 patients still suffering from exercise dyspnoea and PVFS. N = 22 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, N = 16 patients with classic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and N = 17 healthy control patients without relevant cardiac disease underwent dedicated vasodilator-stress CMR studies on a 1.5-T MR scanner. The CMR protocol comprised cine and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging as well as velocity-encoded (VENC) phase-contrast imaging of the coronary sinus flow (CSF) at rest and during pharmacological stress (maximal vasodilation induced by 400 microg IV regadenoson). Using CSF measurements at rest and during stress, global myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was calculated. There was no difference in left ventricular ejection-fraction (LV-EF) between COVID-19 patients and controls (60% [57-63%] vs. 63% [60-66%], p = NS). There were only N = 4 COVID-19 patients (18%) showing a non-ischemic pattern of LGE.

This caused an unprecedented emergency situation with significant negative effects on health and well-being both on an individual and societal level. Apart from health, economic and social consequences, the impact of this pandemic on mental health is increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. The present review aimed to provide a comprehensive discussion of the possible neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, together with the related underlying molecular pathways. In addition, the present review focused on populations which are at a higher risk of developing psychiatric disturbances due to the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed possible routes of clinical management and therapeutics to minimize the burden associated with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, research findings exploring the prevalence of COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms across vulnerable groups, including children, adolescents and COVID-19 survivors are presented, with particular emphasis on those with severe disease who required hospitalization and\/or intensive care unit admission. Based on the available literature, the identification of potential determinants associated with PTSD across the different populations is underlined. Lessons learnt from the pandemics across the globe together with the ongoing research on COVID-19 and its impact on mental health, highlight the utmost importance for evidence-based, proactive and targeted interventions in high-risk groups aiming to mitigate the risks and manage vulnerabilities.","assigned_subjects1":"COVID-19 | traumatic stress disorder | | Stress Disorders, Traumatic"},{"pmid":"34345869","title_e":"Anxiety, depression, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms following COVID-19 infection at long-term follow-up.","authors":"Kyzar EJ, Purpura LJ, Shah J, Cantos A, Nordvig AS, Yin MT, ","abstract":"A developing finding from the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in COVID-19 survivors.

We examined left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular longitudinal strain in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and assessed the correlation with exercise capacity. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients with history of COVID-19 disease who had been referred to rest or stress echocardiography because of symptoms, mainly dyspnea and chest pain, were included in the study. These patients were compared to 106 patients with similar age, symptoms, and risk factor profile with no history of COVID-19 disease. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters, including strain imaging, were assessed. The patient's age was 48 +- 12 years. Twenty-two patients had undergone severe disease. There were no differences in the LV ejection fraction and diastolic function between the groups. However, LV and RV global and free wall strain were significantly lower (in absolute numbers) in patients who had recovered form COVID-19 infection (-20.41 +- 2.32 vs -19.39 +- 3.36, p = 0.001, -23.69 +- 3.44 vs -22.09 +- 4.20, p = 0.001 and -27.24 +- 4.7 vs -25.43 +- 4.93, p = 0.021, respectively). Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) < -20% was present in only 37% of post COVID-19 patients. Sixty-four patients performed exercise echocardiography. Patients with GLS < -20% had higher exercise capacity with higher peak metabolic equivalent and exercise time compared to patients with GLS >= -20% (12.6 +- 2 vs 10 +- 2.5 METss and 8:00 +- 2:08 vs 6:24 +- 2:03 min, p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients, who had recovered from COVID-19 infection, both LV and RV strain are significantly lower compared to control patients. The exercise capacity of these patients correlates with LV strain values. Rest and stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms after COVID-19 infection may identify patients that need further follow up to avoid long term complications of the disease. These preliminary results warrant further research, to test the natural history of these findings and the need and timing of treatment.","assigned_subjects1":"Myocardial Dysfunction | Patients | COVID-19 Disease | Myocardial abnormalities | COVID-19 | infection | LV | ventricular longitudinal | patients | COVID-19 | patients | COVID-19 | stress | dyspnea | chest pain | patients | patients | COVID-19 | patient | patients | LV | LV | patients | COVID-19 | infection | COVID-19 | patients | patients | Patients | patients | patients | COVID-19 | infection | LV | patients | patients | LV | stress | patients | COVID-19 | infection | patients |Cardiomyopathies | | | Infections | | Ventricular Fibrillation | Psychological Distress | Dyspnea | Chest Pain"},{"pmid":"34377750","title_e":"Dynamic functional network connectivity associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.","authors":"Fu Z, Tu Y, Calhoun VD, Zhang Y, Zhao Q, Chen J, Meng Q, Lu Z, Hu L, ","abstract":"Accumulating evidence shows that Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) survivors may encounter prolonged mental issues, especially post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS).

To test this hypothesis, we assessed PTSS and collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospitals and matched controls. Results showed that COVID-19 survivors self-reported a significantly higher PTSS than controls. Tapping into the moment-to-moment variations of the fMRI data, we captured the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) states, and three discriminative reoccurring brain dFNC states were identified. First of all, COVID-19 survivors showed an increased occurrence of a dFNC state with heterogeneous patterns between sensorimotor and visual networks. More importantly, the occurrence rate of this state was significantly correlated with the severity of PTSS. Finally, COVID-19 survivors demonstrated decreased topological organizations in this dFNC state than controls, including the node strength, degree, and local efficiency of the supplementary motor area.

BACKGROUND: Studies have focused on persistent symptoms of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the medium term. Thus, long-term studies of nonhospitalised patients are urgently required. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: In 102 nonhospitalised COVID-19 patients, we collected symptoms at 3 months (baseline) and at 6-7 months (follow-up) from diagnosis (dyspnoea, fatigue\/muscle weakness and chest\/joint pain), HRQoL, psychological state, cognitive function, pulmonary and physical function. This study adhered to the STROBE statement. RESULTS: HRQoL was impaired in almost 60% of the sample and remained impaired 6-7 months. At 3 months, more than 60% had impaired physical function (fatigue\/muscle weakness and reduced leg and inspiratory muscle strength). About 40%-56% of the sample showed an altered psychological state (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety\/depression), cognitive function impairment and dyspnoea. At 6-7-months, only a slight improvement in dyspnoea and physical and cognitive function was observed, with a very high proportion of the sample (29%-55%) remained impaired. Impaired HRQoL at 6-7 months was predicted with 82.4% accuracy (86.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity) by the presence at 3 months of muscle fatigue\/muscle weakness (OR = 5.7 (1.8-18.1)), PTSD (OR = 6.0 (1.7-20.7)) and impaired HRQoL (OR = 11.7 (3.7-36.8)). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of nonhospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience an impaired HRQoL, cognitive and psychological function at long-term. HRQoL, PTSD and dyspnoea at 3 months can identify the majority of patients with COVID-19 who will have impaired quality of life at long-term.

Findings from the logistic regressions suggest that the factors most affecting depression and anxiety in COVID survivors after 12 months were female gender, the presence of anxiety and depression after 4 months and some physical symptoms, not necessarily COVID-related. Impact of infection and consequent hospitalization for COVID-19 did no longer represent a relevant issue for depressive symptoms, compared to other general factors.","assigned_subjects1":"Anxiety | Stress | Depression | COVID-19 | Patients |Anxiety | Psychological Distress | Adjustment Disorders | |"},{"pmid":"35911221","title_e":"The course and determinants of post-traumatic stress over 12 months after hospitalization for COVID-19.","authors":"Stavem K, Heir T, Dammen T, Br\u00f8nstad E, Lerum TV, Durheim MT, Lund KMA, Aarli BB, Einvik G, ","abstract":"Objective: To assess the trajectory of symptoms and symptom-defined post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from 1.5 to 12 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 and determine risk factors for persistent symptoms and PTSD.

Although various immune perturbations were present in Long COVID, low levels of cortisol were prominent and strikingly, depression and anxiety were increased. It has become clear that Long COVID features may be similar to those described in myalgic encephalomyelitis\/chronic fatigue syndrome, post-SARS sickness syndrome, and various chronic stress syndromes which have been linked to hypocortisolemia. Notably, lack of response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to hypocortisolemia shows a suppressed axis in Long COVID.

Methods: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1 and July 31, 2020, were included in a longitudinal study. Clinical assessments were conducted with online auto-questionnaires. PTSS were assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS). We screened for several putative factors associated with PTSS, including socio-demographic status, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, history of psychiatric disorder, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, and the home-to-hospital distance. Bivariate and multilinear regression analyses were performed to evaluate their association with PTSS. Results: 119 patients were evaluated 3 months after hospital discharge, and a subset of 94 were evaluated 6 months after discharge. The prevalence of PTSS was 31.9% after 3 months and 30.9% after 6 months. Symptoms of anxiety and depression and history of psychiatric disorder were independently associated with PTSS. Additionally, dissociative experiences during hospitalization (beta = 0.35; P < .001) and a longer home-to-hospital distance (beta = 0.07; P = .017) were specifically associated with PTSS 3 and 6 months after discharge, respectively. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 showed persistent high scores of PTSS up to 6 months after discharge from the hospital. In this specific pandemic setting, PTSS were associated with high rates of dissociative experiences during hospitalization and a longer home-to-hospital distance due to the saturation of health care facilities.

Method: 75 participants recruited from a post-COVID-19 recovery program and the community were assessed for sociodemographic, medical, psychiatric, and neurocognitive symptoms and performance. The generalized anxiety questionnaire-7 (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire for DSM5 (PCL5) were utilized to measure anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Established cutoff scoring for the GAD-7 and algorithm-based scoring of the PCL5 were utilized to determine clinically significant anxiety symptoms and PTSD, respectively. Results: The cohort was 71% female, 36% ethnic minority, with the main age of 43.5 years, 80% employment, 40% with the prior psychiatric treatment history and 2\/3 seeking post-COVID care for PASC. Clinically significant anxiety symptoms were found in 31% and PTSD was found in 29% of the cohort. Nervousness and excessive worry were the most prominent anxiety symptoms, while changes in mood\/cognition and avoidance were most frequent in PTSD. There was a high degree of comorbidity between clinically significant anxiety symptoms, PTSD, depression and fatigue. In logistic regression, acute COVID illness severity, prior psychiatric history, and memory complaints (but not objective neuropsychological performance) predicted clinically significant anxiety symptoms and\/or PTSD. Conclusion: Clinically significant anxiety and PTSD are found in approximately 1 of 3 individuals after COVID-19 infection.

Preliminary results are based on a group of 32 patients (20 female and 12 male), of average age 57.8 (4.92) years in the period of 3-6 months after the initial infection. Primary outcomes included analysis of lung function, exercise performance and stress level.

Results: The analysis of the results showed a statistically significant improvement in both groups with regard to exercise performance expressed as 6MWT distance. Moreover, a statistically significant decrease in dyspnoea levels following the 6MWT was also noted in intergroup comparison, but the between-group comparison revealed non-statistically significant changes with low effect size. Regarding lung function, the analysis showed essentially normal lung function at baseline and a non-statistically significant improvement after the completion of the rehabilitation program.

We evaluated the presence of psychiatric conditions and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Findings showed greater severity of depressive symptoms, higher levels of stress, and greater CRP in cases. The severity of depressive and insomnia symptoms, as well as the CRP were more remarkable in individuals with moderate\/severe COVID-19.

They may be associated with inflammatory processes due to cellular oxidative stress and an imbalanced antioxidant system. The ability of phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, such as Ginkgo biloba, to alleviate neurological complications and brain tissue damage has attracted strong ongoing interest in the neurotherapeutic management of long COVID. Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (EGb) contains several bioactive ingredients, e.g., bilobalide, quercetin, ginkgolides A-C, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and luteolin. They have various pharmacological and medicinal effects, including memory and cognitive improvement. Ginkgo biloba, through its anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, impacts cognitive function and other illness conditions like those in long COVID. While preclinical research on the antioxidant therapies for neuroprotection has shown promising results, clinical translation remains slow due to several challenges (e.g., low drug bioavailability, limited half-life, instability, restricted delivery to target tissues, and poor antioxidant capacity). This review emphasizes the advantages of nanotherapies using nanoparticle drug delivery approaches to overcome these challenges. Various experimental techniques shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the oxidative stress response in the nervous system and help comprehend the pathophysiology of the neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To develop novel therapeutic agents and drug delivery systems, several methods for mimicking oxidative stress conditions have been used (e.g., lipid peroxidation products, mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors, and models of ischemic brain damage).
