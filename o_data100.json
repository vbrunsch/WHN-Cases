The present study aims to search for correlations between psychiatric response to stress and coping strategies among individuals with acute vs. remitted COVID-19. Ninety subjects with COVID-19 were included in the study, divided into two samples by disease category. Our focus was analysing the perceived stress intensity according to NSESSS and PCL-C-17 scales, and coping strategies with COPE-60. High NSESSS scores were found in 40% of acute patients, and 15.6% of remitted patients had high PCL-C-17 scores fulfilling the criteria for PTSD. We found a negative correlation between stress level and disease category. Acute patients used significantly more engagement and emotion-focused coping methods, but less disengagement types of coping than patients in the remitted phase. Remitted patients under high stress levels are prone to use disengagement and emotion-focused coping strategies. In conclusion, remitted COVID-19 patients experience lower levels of stress and use less emotion-focused strategies, except among those who developed PTSD post-COVID-19 infection, presenting with high-stress levels and using more disengagement and emotion-focused types of coping strategies.","assigned_subjects1":"Stress Related Disorders | Patients | COVID-19 |Psychological Distress | |"},{"pmid":"34341978","title_e":"[Neuropsychiatric Aspects of COVID-19 - A Narrative Overview].","authors":"Rittmannsberger H, Barth M, Malik P, Yazdi K, ","abstract":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2) and COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) can affect numerous organ systems. In the present paper we offer an overview of the current state of knowledge about the psychiatric aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Medline, Embase und LIVIVO were searched for relevant literature, the last query dating from March 2nd, 2021. Different stress factors in the context of the pandemic can lead to manifest mental illnesses. In addition, there is a risk of neuropsychological changes due to the biological effects of the virus itself.Our work describes the psychological symptoms of COVID-19 sufferers themselves and the psychological effects of the epidemic and the associated socio-economic and psychosocial stress factors on those who are not sick.The most common psychiatric complication among people with COVID-19 is delirium, while hospitalized patients seem to have an increased incidence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD. There are many case reports on psychotic disorders. In general, an existing psychiatric illness (especially dementia and psychotic disorders) also increases the risk of infection and of a more severe course of the disease. After recovery from COVID-19 infection, there is also a higher incidence of mental illnesses, in particular \"Chronic Post-SARS Syndrome\" with its manifestations such as fatigue, anxiety, depression and PTSD. In addition, the course of dementia seems to be negatively influenced by an infection with SARS-CoV-2.The second part deals with the effects of the epidemic as a stressor and the established socio-political measures on the mental health of people with and without previous mental illnesses. The literature currently available shows high symptom values for anxiety and depressive disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorders, stress, suicidality, sleep disorders etc. Risk factors seem to include female gender, younger age and fewer resources, as well as previous psychiatric or physical illnesses. Extrinsic factors such as high infection rates, large numbers of deaths, long curfews\/lockdowns, low trust in the government and ineffective measures against economic and social consequences increase the burden.","assigned_subjects1":"COVID-19 | SARS-CoV-2 | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus | Coronavirus Disease 2019 | psychiatric | SARS-CoV-2 infection | stress | COVID-19 | psychosocial stress | psychiatric | people | COVID-19 | delirium | patients | anxiety | depression | PTSD | psychotic disorders | psychiatric illness | dementia and psychotic disorders | infection | COVID-19 | infection | SARS Syndrome | fatigue | anxiety | depression | PTSD | dementia | infection | SARS-CoV-2 | people | anxiety | depressive disorders | traumatic stress disorders | stress | sleep disorders | psychiatric | infection | deaths | | | | Mental Disorders | Psychological Distress | | Delirium | Anxiety | Adjustment Disorders | Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic | Psychotic Disorders | Infections | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome | Fatigue | Dementia | Stress Disorders, Traumatic | Sleep Wake Disorders | Death"},{"pmid":"36134735","title_e":"Research of the Coronavirus Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Quality of Life, and Stress Coping Styles in COVID-19 Survivors.","authors":"Korkut S, ","abstract":"The COVID-19 survivors suffer from severe psychosocial challenges related to the current pandemic. In this context, it was aimed to evaluate the coronavirus anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and also determine the quality of life (QOL), and coping styles with stress in survivors by comparing them with non-COVID controls (NCs). This study was conducted from April 15 to October 15, 2021, as a cross-sectional study design. The study included 339 survivors who were confirmed with COVID-19 through clinical tests in the last 3 months and 321 NCs who had not been infected with COVID-19. Besides sociodemographic and clinical data, a set of valid and reliable assessment tools were used to measure outcomes of coronavirus anxiety, coping styles, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, and quality of life. The total scores of IES-R, GAD-7, and CAS were significantly higher in survivors than in the NCs. These results revealed that survivors manifested higher levels of coronavirus anxiety, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (p < 0.05). In survivors, the rates of GAD and coronavirus anxiety were found to be 59.3% and 25.7%, respectively. Additionally, the majority of survivors (89.4%) reported the severity of anxiety as moderate to severe, and also almost two-thirds of them reported the psychological impact of the pandemic as moderate to severe. Furthermore, survivors were found to have a lower quality of life. The findings of this study indicate that survivors experienced higher levels of coronavirus anxiety, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, and had lower QOL. In addition, it was determined that survivors haven't been using active styles adequately in coping with stress. Thus, psychological intervention studies should be conducted and public mental health strategies should be developed. Providing psychosocial support and psychological guidance will contribute to mental health well-being, and improve the QOL and coping strategies.","assigned_subjects1":"Coronavirus Anxiety | Traumatic Stress | Anxiety | Stress | COVID-19 |Anxiety | Psychological Distress |"},{"pmid":"36976130","title_e":"Association between Stress and Physical Fitness of University Students Post-COVID-19 Pandemic.","authors":"Suwannakul B, Sangkarit N, Manoy P, Amput P, Tapanya W, ","abstract":"Post-COVID-19 pandemic, most universities changed their educational model from online courses to onsite learning, allowing students to attend regular face-to-face classes.

METHOD: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 +- 18.9, 47.3 +- 13.1, and 43.2 +- 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) hospitalisation is a potentially traumatic experience, especially in severe cases. Furthermore, the unprecedented context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, with daily media bombardment about COVID-19 mortality, may have amplified life-threatening perception also in patients with moderate infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PTSD at 3-month follow-up in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: In this cohort follow-up study conducted in a large Italian academic COVID-19 hospital, 115 recruited survivors were contacted by telephone 3 months after discharge to home care. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 was administered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors for the development of PTSD. KEY RESULTS: A total of 10.4% of the sample received a PCL-5-based diagnosis of PTSD. Other 8.6% of the sample received a diagnosis of subthreshold PTSD, which leads to significant levels of distress and impairment. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that previous psychiatric diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-78.6, p < 0.001) and obesity (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.4-857.9, p = 0.03) were risk factors for developing PTSD. Chronic pulmonary diseases approached significance as a risk factor (OR = 6.03, 95% CI: 1.0-37.1, p = 0.053). Male sex was a protective factor (OR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.0-0.041, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD and subthreshold PTSD rates in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 are worrying. Female sex and pre-existing mental disorders are established risk factors for PTSD, while the prospective association with obesity needs further investigation. Clinicians treating COVID-19 should consider screening for PTSD at follow-up assessments in patients discharged from the hospital.","assigned_subjects1":"traumatic Stress | COVID-19 | traumatic stress disorder | mental disorder | Coronavirus disease 19 | COVID-19 | severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 | COVID-19 | mortality | patients | infection | patients | COVID-19 | infection | COVID-19 | Posttraumatic Stress | psychiatric | obesity | pulmonary diseases | patients | COVID-19 | mental disorders | obesity | COVID-19 | patients |Psychological Distress | | Stress Disorders, Traumatic | Mental Disorders | | Death | | Infections | Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic | Obesity | Lung Diseases"},{"pmid":"34968807","title_e":"Risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 recovered patients.

Five hundred and six participants completed a battery of standardized questionnaires. All the scales used in this study are valid and reliable measures of their respective constructs. Results showed that high levels of alexithymia, dissociation, anxiety, and depression statistically significantly predicted the three main clusters of PTSD symptoms (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Furthermore, negative affectivity and psychoticism significantly predicted PTSD symptoms in our sample. Finally, individuals hospitalized by COVID-19 are more at risk of developing intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than those who never needed hospital care.

Objectives: To determine the impact of the severe hospitalized COVID-19 on global and regional myocardial perfusion in recovered patients. Methods: A case-control study of previously hospitalized, troponin-positive COVID-19 patients was undertaken. The results were compared with a propensity-matched, pre-COVID chest pain cohort (referred for clinical CMR; angiography subsequently demonstrating unobstructed coronary arteries) and 27 healthy volunteers (HV). The analysis used visual assessment for the regional perfusion defects and AI-based segmentation to derive the global and regional stress and rest MBF. Results: Ninety recovered post-COVID patients {median age 64 [interquartile range (IQR) 54-71] years, 83% male, 44% requiring the intensive care unit (ICU)} underwent adenosine-stress perfusion CMR at a median of 61 (IQR 29-146) days post-discharge.

Thirty-two patients (36%) had adenosine-induced regional perfusion defects, 26 out of 32 with at least one segment without prior infarction.

Conclusions: After severe hospitalized COVID-19 infection, patients who attended clinical ischemia testing had little evidence of significant microvascular disease at 2 months post-discharge. The high prevalence of regional inducible ischemia and\/or infarction (nearly 40%) may suggest that occult coronary disease is an important putative mechanism for troponin elevation in this cohort.

The aim of this study is to assess HRQoL and the occurrence of stress-related disorders (acute stress disorder [ASD] and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) in C-ARDS ICU survivors at 1 and 6 months following hospital discharge. Methods: This prospective observational study included 90 patients treated for C-ARDS between March and May 2020 in the ICU and discharged alive from the hospital. All patients included in the study were contacted by telephone 1 month and 6 months post-hospital discharge to assess the presence of symptoms of stress-related disorders and HRQoL using the 8-item Treatment Outcome Post-traumatic Stress Disorder scale (TOP-8) and 36-item Short Form survey (SF-36). We performed univariate analyses to evaluate differences between patients who developed stress and those who did not. We also compared SF-36 scores in our sample with data from the general Spanish population and from cohorts of non-C-ARDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) survivors.

Given the lethal potential and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019, a high risk of posttraumatic stress disorder was identified in the beginning of the crisis. There are insufficient details in current literature and no official guidelines available for the treatment and follow-up of acute stress disorder and the prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder for intensive care unit survivors in the context of coronavirus disease 2019. CASE PRESENTATION: We hereby describe a 67-year-old Swiss patient presenting a psychiatric reaction in the context of coronavirus disease 2019. He was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and intubated for 13 days. Afterwards, there was a severe worsening of acute renal failure prompting hemodialysis, and he developed delirium. Psychiatric liaison was requested 4 days post-intubation because the patient presented residual symptoms of delirium, false memories about the real context of his medical care, and ideas of persecution toward medical caregivers. He suffered from a very strong peritraumatic reaction, then developed an acute stress disorder linked with his care on the intensive care unit. We looked for strategies to prevent progression from acute stress disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder. We proceeded to the following therapeutic interventions: intensive psychiatric follow-up, intensive care unit diary, and low-dose antipsychotic treatment. The aim of our psychotherapeutic approach was to allow him to increase his feeling of security and to cope with the reality of his traumatic experience. He showed clinical improvement in his mental state after 3 months, despite several predictive factors of evolution to post-intensive care unit posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates how a delusional clinical presentation after intensive care in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 can hide psychotraumatic symptoms. It is important to highlight that the intensive care unit diary completed by the intensive care team and the follow-up by the psychiatric liaison team helped the patient reconstruct an appropriate and coherent account. Further studies are needed to determine the psychiatric effects of coronavirus disease 2019 and to assess early and appropriate psychiatric intervention for patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder.","assigned_subjects1":"coronavirus disease 2019 |"},{"pmid":"35796878","title_e":"Psychological outcomes of COVID-19 survivors at sixth months after diagnose: the role of kynurenine pathway metabolites in depression, anxiety, and stress.","authors":"Kucukkarapinar M, Yay-Pence A, Yildiz Y, Buyukkoruk M, Yaz-Aydin G, Deveci-Bulut TS, Gulbahar O, Senol E, Candansayar S, ","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in long-term psychiatric symptoms because of the immunologic response to the virus itself as well as fundamental life changes related to the pandemic.

We aimed to define TKP changes as a potential underlying mechanism of psychiatric disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. We measured plasma levels of several TKP markers, including KYN, TRP, kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and quinolinic acid (QUIN), as well as the TRP\/KYN, KYNA\/3-HK, and KYNA\/QUIN ratios, in 90 post-COVID-19 patients (on the first day of hospitalization) and 59 healthy controls (on the first admission to the Check-Up Center).

TRP and 3-HK were negative predictors of anxiety and stress, but KYN positively predicted anxiety and stress. Moreover, TRP negatively predicted depression, while KYNA\/3-HK was a negative predictor of anxiety. The correlation between depression, anxiety, and stress and TKP activation in COVID-19 could provide prospective biomarkers, especially the reduction in TRP and 3HK levels and the increase in KYN. Our results suggest that the alteration of TKP is not only a potential biomarker of viral infection-related long-term psychiatric disorders but also that the therapy targets future viral infections related to depression and anxiety.","assigned_subjects1":"COVID-19 | kynurenine | depression | anxiety | stress | | | Adjustment Disorders | Anxiety | Psychological Distress"},{"pmid":"37186604","title_e":"Relationship between physical performance and perception of stress and recovery in daily life post COVID-19-An explorative study.","authors":"Zorn J, Vollrath S, Matits L, Schönfelder M, Schulz SVW, Jerg A, Steinacker JM, Bizjak DA,","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease which can target the lungs and the cardiovascular system and can also affect parts of the brain for prolonged periods of time.

While it is evident that COVID-19, like other viral infections, may have an influence on physical performance, monitoring stress and recovery perceptions of athletes is critical to facilitate their return-to-sports, while minimizing long-term COVID-19 induced negative effects like the athletic objective and subjective perceived recovery and stress levels.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"34776871","title_e":"PTSD as an Endothelial Disease: Insights From COVID-19.","authors":"Sfera A, Osorio C, Rahman L, Zapata-Mart\u00edn Del Campo CM, Maldonado JC, Jafri N, Cummings MA, Maurer S, Kozlakidis Z, ","abstract":"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has affected almost every aspect of human life, precipitating stress-related pathology in vulnerable individuals. As the prevalence rate of posttraumatic stress disorder in pandemic survivors exceeds that of the general and special populations, the virus may predispose to this disorder by directly interfering with the stress-processing pathways. The SARS-CoV-2 interactome has identified several antigens that may disrupt the blood-brain-barrier by inducing premature senescence in many cell types, including the cerebral endothelial cells. This enables the stress molecules, including angiotensin II, endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, to aberrantly activate the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex, increasing the vulnerability to stress related disorders. This is supported by observing the beneficial effects of angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in both posttraumatic stress disorder and SARS-CoV-2 critical illness. In this narrative review, we take a closer look at the virus-host dialog and its impact on the renin-angiotensin system, mitochondrial fitness, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We discuss the role of furin cleaving site, the fibrinolytic system, and Sigma-1 receptor in the pathogenesis of psychological trauma. In other words, learning from the virus, clarify the molecular underpinnings of stress related disorders, and design better therapies for these conditions. In this context, we emphasize new potential treatments, including furin and bromodomains inhibitors.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"33198962","title_e":"Depression, Anxiety, and Acute Stress Disorder Among Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study.","authors":"Parker C, Shalev D, Hsu I, Shenoy A, Cheung S, Nash S, Wiener I, Fedoronko D, Allen N, Shapiro PA, ","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of psychiatric symptoms among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: This article sought to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and acute stress disorder among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: Adult patients recently admitted to nonintensive care unit medical ward settings with coronavirus disease 2019 were eligible for enrollment. Enrolled patients were screened for depression, anxiety, and delirium. Subsequently, patients were followed up by phone after 2 weeks and rescreened for depression, anxiety, and acute stress disorder symptoms. Subjects' medical records were abstracted for clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 58 subjects were enrolled; of whom, 44 completed the study. Initially, 36% of subjects had elevated anxiety symptoms and 29% had elevated depression symptoms. At 2-week follow-up, 9% had elevated anxiety symptoms, 20% had elevated depression symptoms, and 25% had mild-to-moderate acute stress disorder symptoms. Discharge to home was not associated with improvement in psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety. While anxiety improved after index admission, depression remained fairly stable. Furthermore, a significant minority of patients experienced acute stress disorder symptoms, though these were largely mild to moderate.","assigned_subjects1":"Depression | Anxiety | Acute Stress | Patients | COVID-19 | Adjustment Disorders | Anxiety | Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute |"},{"pmid":"34285348","title_e":"Post-traumatic stress symptoms in COVID-19 survivors: a self-report and brain imaging follow-up study.","authors":"Tu Y, Zhang Y, Li Y, Zhao Q, Bi Y, Lu X, Kong Y, Wang L, Lu Z, Hu L, ","abstract":"Previous coronavirus pandemics were associated elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), but the self-report and neurological basis of PTSS in patients who survived coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are largely unknown.

The control groups were non-COVID-19 locals. Session 1 was completed for 126 COVID-19 survivors and 126 controls. Session 2 was completed for 47 COVID-19 survivors and 43 controls. The total score of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) score was significantly higher in COVID-19 survivors compared with controls in both sessions. The PCL-5 score in COVID-19 survivors was positively correlated with the duration after discharge (r = 0.27, p = 0.003 for Session 1), and increased by 20% from Session 1 to Session 2 for the survivors who participated both sessions. The increase was positively correlated with individual's test-retest duration (r = 0.46, p = 0.03). Brain structural volume and functional activity in bilateral hippocampus and amygdala were significantly larger in COVID-19 survivors compared with controls.

PATIENTS: Adults who had critical illness due to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring an ICU stay of 7 days or more and who agreed to a telehealth follow-up in the critical care recovery clinic 1-month post hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient-reported outcome measures assessing physical and psychiatric domains were collected electronically, a cognitive test was performed by a clinician, and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical records. Outcome measures assessed postintensive care syndrome symptoms in the physical (Modified Rankin Scale, Dalhousie Clinical Frailty Scale, Neuro-Quality of Life Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Function, Neuro-Quality of Life Fatigue), psychiatric (Insomnia Severity Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), and cognitive (Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment) domains. The 3-Level Version of Euro-QoL-5D was used to assess the physical and psychiatric domains. A diagnosis of postintensive care syndrome was made in cases with evidence of impairment in at least one postintensive care syndrome domain. We included 45 patients with a mean (sd) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome.

PATIENTS: Adult COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors, invasively ventilated in the ICU, were eligible for a neurologic consultation between 3 and 6 months post ICU discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Follow-up by face-to-face neurologic consultation. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was favorable functional outcome defined by a modified Rankin scale score less than 2, indicating survival with no significant disability. Secondary endpoints included mild cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score < 26), ICU-acquired weakness (Medical Research Council score < 48), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression score > 7), and posttraumatic stress disorder (posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 score > 30). Of 54 eligible survivors, four non-French-speaking patients were excluded, eight patients were lost-to-follow-up, and one died during follow-up. Forty-one patients were included. Time between ICU discharge and neurologic consultation was 3.8 months (3.6-5.9 mo). A favorable functional outcome was observed in 16 patients (39%) and mild cognitive impairment in 17 of 33 patients tested (52%). ICU-acquired weakness, depression or anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder were reported in six of 37 cases (16%), eight of 31 cases (26%), and two of 27 cases (7%), respectively.

Patients who recovered from moderate-to-severe COVID-19 respiratory distress demonstrate long-term functional impairment. During the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 induces the generation of reactive oxygen species that can be amplified to a \"cytokine storm\". The resultant inflammatory and oxidative stress process causes organ damage, particularly in the respiratory system, with the lungs as the tissues most susceptible to injury. The acute illness often requires a long-term hospital stay and consequent sarcopenia. Upon discharge, muscle weakness compounded by limited lung and cardiac function is often accompanied by dyspnea, myalgia, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Consequently, these patients could benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), with exercise as a critical intervention (including sessions of strength and endurance or aerobic exercises). Unfortunately, conventional CONC exercises induce significant cardiopulmonary stress and increase inflammatory and oxidative stress (OS) when performed at moderate\/high intensity, which can exacerbate debilitating dyspnoea and muscle fatigue post-COVID-19. Eccentric training (ECC) is a well-tolerated alternative that improves muscle mass while mitigating cardiopulmonary stress in patients with COPD and other chronic diseases. Similar benefits could be realized in post-COVID-19 patients. Consequently, these patients could benefit from PR with exercise as a critical intervention.","assigned_subjects1":"COVID-19 | Patients | Inflammation | Stress | | | Inflammation | Psychological Distress"},{"pmid":"33585298","title_e":"Psychological outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19: data from a multidisciplinary follow-up screening program for recovered patients.","authors":"Bonazza F, Borghi L, di San Marco EC, Piscopo K, Bai F, Monforte AD, Vegni E, ","abstract":"Patients who are hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) face an extremely stressful experience that might challenge their mental health.

Multiple biological and psychosocial factors contribute to anxiety in COVID-19. Among the biological factors, stress, genetics, gender, immune system, resilience, anosmia, hypogeusia, and central nervous system infection with SARS-CoV-2 are key. Anxiety is a complication of COVID-19 that may exacerbate the infection course, and the infection may exacerbate anxiety. We present the mechanisms of anxiety in symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. We discuss the presentation of anxiety in patients without or with prior psychiatric illness, and with co-morbidities. Timely diagnosis and management of anxiety in COVID-19 patients is important. Given the frequent complication of COVID-19 with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Intensive Care Unit stay, anxiety may be a long-term complication. We review the diagnostic tools for anxiety in COVID-19, and summarise pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. We provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and follow up of anxiety in COVID-19.Key pointsPatients with COVID-19 (symptomatic or asymptomatic) exhibit a high frequency of neuropsychiatric complications with highest percentage attributed to anxiety.Multiple biological and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety exist in COVID-19-ill individuals. Biological risk factors include stress, resilience, genetics, gender, age, immune system, direct infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with SARS-CoV-2, comorbid psychiatric and general medical illnesses, ARDS and ICU stay. Anosmia and hypogeusia are COVID-19-specific anxiety risk factors. Knowledge of the anxiety risk factors is essential to focus on timely interventions, because anxiety may be a complication of and exacerbate the COVID-19 course.An inverse correlation exists between resilience and anxiety because of COVID-19, and therefore efforts should be made to increase resilience in COVID-19 patients.In COVID-19, important anxiety mechanism is neuroinflammation resulting from activation of the immune system and an ensuing cytokine storm.The general approach to management of anxiety in COVID-19 should be compassionate, similar to that during trauma or disaster, with efforts focussed on instilling a sense of hope and resilience.In selecting pharmacological treatment of anxiety, the stress response and immune system effects should be key. Medications with cardio-respiratory adverse effects should be avoided in patients with respiratory problems.Anxiety is a disorder that will require for long-term follow up at least one month after COVID-19.","assigned_subjects1":"anxiety | COVID-19 | infection | COVID-19 | COVID-19 | anxiety | anxiety | COVID-19 | stress | anosmia | hypogeusia | central nervous system infection | SARS-CoV-2 | Anxiety | COVID-19 | infection | infection | anxiety | anxiety | COVID-19 | anxiety | patients | psychiatric illness | anxiety | COVID-19 | patients | COVID-19 | Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome | anxiety | anxiety | COVID-19 | anxiety | COVID-19 | COVID-19 | anxiety | anxiety | COVID-19-ill | stress | infection | SARS-CoV-2 | psychiatric | ARDS | Anosmia | hypogeusia | COVID-19 | anxiety | anxiety | anxiety | COVID-19 | anxiety | COVID-19 | COVID-19 | patients | COVID-19 | anxiety | anxiety | COVID-19 | trauma | anxiety | stress | patients | Anxiety | COVID-19 |Anxiety | | Infections | Psychological Distress | Olfaction Disorders | Ageusia | Central Nervous System Infections | | | Mental Disorders | Respiratory Distress Syndrome | Wounds and Injuries"},{"pmid":"33528827","title_e":"Prevalence and correlates of chronic fatigue syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder after the outbreak of the COVID-19.","authors":"Simani L, Ramezani M, Darazam IA, Sagharichi M, Aalipour MA, Ghorbani F, Pakdaman H, ","abstract":"As the SARS-COV-2 becomes a global pandemic, many researchers have a concern about the long COVID-19 complications.

We investigated psychological morbidities such as CFS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among survivors of COVID-19 over 6 months. All COVID-19 survivors from the university-affiliated hospital of Tehran, Iran, were assessed 6 months after infection onset by a previously validated questionnaire based on the Fukuda guidelines for CFS\/EM and DSM-5 Checklist for PTSD (The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 or PCL-5) to determine the presence of stress disorder and chronic fatigue problems. A total of 120 patients were enrolled. The prevalence rate of fatigue symptoms was 17.5%. Twelve (10%) screened positive for chronic idiopathic fatigue (CIF), 6 (5%) for CFS-like with insufficient fatigue syndrome (CFSWIFS), and 3 (2.5%) for CFS.

CONCLUSION: Patients with EVALI, despite their youth, commonly have significant long-term respiratory disability, cognitive impairment, symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and persistent vaping.","assigned_subjects1":"Patients | Lung Injury | lung injury | mood disorder | patients | mood disorder | patients | patients | depression | anxiety | traumatic stress | respiratory disability | Covid-19 | infection | mood symptoms | patients | patients | cognitive impairment | Mood disorders | anxiety | depression | traumatic stress | Covid-19 | infection | people | cognitive impairment | dyspnea | mood symptoms | Patients | respiratory disability | cognitive impairment | depression | anxiety | traumatic stress | | Lung Injury | Mood Disorders | Adjustment Disorders | Anxiety | Psychological Distress | Respiratory Insufficiency | | Infections | Headache Disorders, Secondary | Cognition Disorders | Dyspnea"},{"pmid":"37547381","title_e":"Influence of Prosthodontic Rehabilitation Using Zygomatic Implants in Covid 19 Related Mucormycosis (Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral) Maxillectomy Patients Upon Post-Operative Stress, Anxiety and Functional Impairment: A Prospective Cohort Study.","authors":"Kumar L, Verma A, Pal US, Mattoo K, Algarni YA, Bin Hassan SA, Baba SM, Jeri SY, Khateeb SU, ","abstract":"Purpose: To determine the influence of prosthodontic rehabilitation using zygomatic implants in partial maxillectomy upon post-operative stress, anxiety and functional impairment, due to covid 19 associated rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). Patients and Methods: Twenty maxillectomy patients fulfilling study criterion, received zygomatic implants (ZI) (quad zygoma) (ZDI Simpladent, Switzerland) retained\/supported complete maxillary denture. Assessment of stress, anxiety, masticatory performance and speech were determined using diurnal salivary cortisol level, Appearance Anxiety Inventory, multiple sieve technique and auditory perception analysis, respectively. Data were recorded at 6 different stages of rehabilitation (after maxillectomy, implant placement, and after prosthesis delivery (1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year)). Demographic data were expressed as frequency distribution, while mean values were used to find differences between various rehabilitation stages using Friedman and chi-square test with statistical significance value at p < 0.05. Results: Average daily salivary cortisol levels declined from post maxillectomy (22.80 +- 0.902) to 1 year after prosthesis wearing (8.65 +- 0.985), indicating stress reduction after ZI rehabilitation. Mean scores for appearance anxiety reduced from pre-prosthetic rehabilitation (27.350 +- 3.030) to 1 year (8.950 +- 0.887) following prosthesis wearing. Functional parameters for mastication and speech also improved significantly during the course of rehabilitation. All differences between pre-prosthetic to 1-year stage after prosthesis wearing were found to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Conclusion: Post ROCM maxillectomy cases after prosthetic rehabilitation using zygomatic implants showed significant improvement in the psychological (stress and anxiety) as well as function (mastication and speech) characteristics. Rehabilitation post ROCM maxillectomy with the present approach of fixed prosthesis using zygomatic implants mitigates deficient mastication and speech. It also impacts positively on patient psychology by decreasing stress and anxiety.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"36850042","title_e":"Post-traumatic stress symptoms six months after ICU admission with COVID-19: Prospective observational study.","authors":"Fjone KS, Buanes EA, Småstuen MC, Laake JH, Stubberud J, Hofsø K,","abstract":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms, and to identify possible predictive factors in Norwegian intensive care unit survivors, 6 months after admission to the intensive care unit with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The SARS CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 has spread worldwide since it was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The most severely ill patients have been treated in the intensive care due to acute respiratory failure and also acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is well documented that these severe conditions can lead to complex and long-lasting symptoms, such as psychological distress, and was, therefore, investigated for the specific COVID-19 population. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Clinical data and patient reported outcome measures were collected by the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry and by the study group 6 months after admission to an intensive care unit. RESULTS: Among 222 COVID-19 patients admitted to Norwegian intensive care units between 10 March and 6 July 2020, 175 survived. The study sample consisted of 131 patients who responded to at least one patient reported outcome measure at 6 months following admission. The primary outcome was self-reported post-traumatic stress symptoms, using the Impact of Event Scale-6 (n = 89). Of those, 22.5% reported post-traumatic stress symptoms 6 months after admission. Female gender, younger age and having a high respiratory rate at admission were statistically significant predictive factors for reporting post-traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The result is in accordance with previously published research with comparable populations, suggesting that for many COVID-19 survivors psychological distress is a part of the post-acute sequelae. Results from the present study should be replicated in larger datasets.

This study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of mental health issues among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Methods: A semi-structured proforma for socio-demographic and clinical parameters was used to collect cross-sectional hospital-based data of subjects who tested positive for COVID-19 infection. The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to assess the presence of physical, psychological, and cognitive symptoms. The presence of anxiety, depression, and stress was based on the cut-off scores for HADS-A (>=8), HADS-D (>=8), and PSS (>=14), respectively. Results: A total of 101 patients comprising 39 (38.6%) males were recruited. Compared to nuclear families, we observed that patients living in joint families had significantly greater severity scores for fatigue [MFIS (p = 0.04)], anxiety [HADS-A (p = 0.004)], depression [HADS-D (p = 0.004)], and stress [PSS (p = 0.02)]. Based on the cut-off scores, we found that 44 (43.6%) patient had anxiety, 41 (40.6%) had depressive, and 72 (71.3%) had moderate to high stress symptoms, respectively. We also observed significantly greater fatigue and anxiety scores, that is, MFIS (p = 0.008) and HADS-A (p = 0.03) in those who received oxygen therapy compared to those who did not. The subjects who received corticosteroids were older (p = 0.01) and had significantly higher stress scores [PSS (p < 0.001)]. The study showed that patients who were assessed more than 3 months post-COVID-19 infection had higher fatigue and depression scores; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (MFIS P = 0.058; HADS P = 0.059).

However, the neurovascular responses to mental stress and exercise are still unexplored. We hypothesized that COVID-19 survivors compared with age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls exhibit abnormal neurovascular responses to mental stress and physical exercise. METHODS: Fifteen severe COVID-19 survivors (aged: 49+-2 years, BMI: 30+-1 kg\/m2) and 15 well-matched control subjects (aged: 46+-3 years, BMI: 29+-1 kg\/m2) were studied. MSNA (microneurography), forearm blood flow (FBF), and forearm vascular conductance (FVC, venous occlusion plethysmography), mean arterial pressure (MAP, Finometer), and heart rate (HR, EKG) were measured during a 3-minutes mental stress (Stroop color word test) and during a 3-minutes isometric handgrip exercise (30% of maximal voluntary contraction). RESULTS: During mental stress, MSNA (frequency and incidence) responses were higher in COVID-19 survivors than in controls (P<0.001), and FBF and FVC responses were attenuated (P<0.05). MAP was similar between the groups (P>0.05). In contrast, the MSNA (frequency and incidence), and FBF and FVC responses to handgrip exercise were similar between the groups (P>0.05). MAP was lower in COVID-19 survivors (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 survivors exhibit an exaggerated MSNA and blunted vasodilatory response to mental challenge compared to healthy adults. However, the neurovascular response to handgrip exercise is preserved in COVID-19 survivors. Overall, the abnormal neurovascular control in response to mental stress suggests that COVID-19 survivors may have an increased risk to cardiovascular events during mental challenge.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"37658773","title_e":"Effectiveness of Functional or Aerobic Exercise Combined with Breathing Techniques in Telerehabilitation for Patients with Long COVID: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","authors":"Espinoza-Bravo C, Arnal-Gómez A, Martínez-Arnau FM, Núñez-Cortés R, Hernández-Guillén D, Flor-Rufino C, Cortés-Amador S,","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the short-term clinical effects of 2 telerehabilitation programs, functional versus aerobic exercises, both combined with breathing techniques, regarding the improvement of long COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The participants were assigned randomly to either the functional exercise (FE) group or aerobic exercise (AE) group, both including breathing techniques. The interventions lasted for 8 weeks with 3 sessions per week, and they were conducted through the Fisiotrack mobile phone application. Assessments were performed at baseline and after treatment, including testing fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnea (London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale), functional performance (30 Seconds Standing Test), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire), and quality of life (European Quality of Life Scale). The perceived change after treatment (Patient Global Impression of Change Scale), the usability of the application (System Usability Scale), and the adherence to treatment were also examined after treatment. RESULTS: In total, 43 participants (FE group, n = 21; AE group, n = 22; mean age = 42.4 [SD = 6.5] y) completed the study. In the intragroup comparison, the FE group showed improved fatigue (-6.7 points; 95% CI = -11.9 to -1.3), functional capacity (2.6 repetitions; 95% CI = 0.3 to 4.9), and perceived stress (-4.9 points; 95% CI = -9.1 to 0.8), while the AE group showed improved perceived stress (-6.2 points; 95% CI = -10.3 to -2.1). No significant differences in the intergroup effect were identified for the studied variables. Significant differences were observed in the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale in favor of the FE group compared to the AE group, and quality of life reached the minimal clinically important difference for both groups. The ease of use of the telerehabilitation tool was rated excellent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both telerehabilitation exercise modalities are effective at improving stress symptoms and quality of life in patients with long COVID-19. For improving fatigue and functional performance, functional exercise shows more promising results. IMPACT: Functional exercise or aerobic exercise may be recommended depending on patients' symptoms, and both may improve quality of life and stress symptoms in patients with long COVID-19.

The individuals with the most severe symptoms and the highest risk of death are the elderly and those with chronic illness. Among chronic conditions, those with a certain degree of chronic inflammation may predispose to a more severe evolution of COVID-19. Elderly with psychiatric disorders can present a persistent inflammatory state, a characteristic of the age's immunological senescence, but the disorder can accentuate that. Social isolation is still the safest way to avoid contamination. However, isolated older people may have or worsen mental health conditions due to isolation and health concerns. In this scenario, a SARS-CoV-2 infection may progress to more severe disease. Conversely, COVID-19 can predispose or aggravate psychiatric disorders, as it induces a cytokine storm, causing systemic hyper inflammation. It may damage the blood-brain barrier, resulting in inflammation in the central nervous system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to reach and trigger an inflammatory process directly in the nervous system.

However, no clear pathophysiological explanation, as yet, has been provided. A novel paradigm for a Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome is developed here from a recent unifying model for ME\/CFS. Central to its rationale, SARS-CoV-2, in common with the triggers (viral and non-viral) of ME\/CFS, is proposed to be a physiologically severe stressor, which could be targeting a stress-integrator, within the brain: the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). It is proposed that inflammatory mediators, released at the site of COVID-19 infection, would be transmitted as stress-signals, via humoral and neural pathways, which overwhelm this stress-center. In genetically susceptible people, an intrinsic stress-threshold is suggested to be exceeded causing ongoing dysfunction to the hypothalamic PVN's complex neurological circuitry. In this compromised state, the hypothalamic PVN might then be hyper-sensitive to a wide range of life's ongoing physiological stressors. This could result in the reported post-exertional malaise episodes and more severe relapses, in common with ME\/CFS, that perpetuate an ongoing disease state. When a certain stress-tolerance-level is exceeded, the hypothalamic PVN can become an epicenter for microglia-induced activation and neuroinflammation, affecting the hypothalamus and its proximal limbic system, which would account for the range of reported ME\/CFS-like symptoms. A model for Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome is provided to stimulate discussion and critical evaluation. Brain-scanning studies, incorporating increasingly sophisticated imaging technology should enable chronic neuroinflammation to be detected, even at a low level, in the finite detail required, thus helping to test this model, while advancing our understanding of Post-COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome pathophysiology.","assigned_subjects1":"Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome | ME\/CFS | COVID-19 | patients | COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome | Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | ME\/CFS | COVID-19 | Fatigue Syndrome | ME\/CFS | SARS-CoV-2 | ME\/CFS | hypothalamic paraventricular | COVID-19 | infection | people | hypothalamic | hypothalamic | malaise episodes | ME\/CFS | hypothalamic | neuroinflammation | hypothalamus | ME\/CFS | COVID-19 | Fatigue Syndrome | neuroinflammation | COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome | | Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic | | Fatigue | | Hypothalamic Diseases | Infections | | Neurogenic Inflammation | Hypothalamic Neoplasms"},{"pmid":"34589715","title_e":"One-Year Functional, Cognitive, and Psychological Outcomes Following the Use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Prospective Study.","authors":"Rajajee V, Fung CM, Seagly KS, Park PK, Raghavendran K, Machado-Aranda DA, Scott JW, Delano MJ, Abou El Ela ASAA, Haft JW, Williamson CA, McSparron JI, Blank R, Napolitano LM, ","abstract":"To prospectively describe 1-year outcomes, with a focus on functional outcome, cognitive outcome, and the burden of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, in coronavirus disease 2019 patients managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

As vaccines become available, their distribution, safety, and efficacy against emerging variants remain uncertain, and specific treatments are lacking. Recent Advances: Initially affecting the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multisystems disease that disturbs the whole-body redox balance and can be long-lasting (Long-COVID). Numerous risk factors have been identified, but the reasons for variations in susceptibility to infection, disease severity, and outcome are poorly understood. The reactive species interactome (RSI) was recently introduced as a framework to conceptualize how cells and whole organisms sense, integrate, and accommodate stress. Critical Issues: We here consider COVID-19 as a redox disease, offering a holistic perspective of its effects on the human body, considering the vulnerability of complex interconnected systems with multiorgan\/multilevel interdependencies. Host\/viral glycan interactions underpin SARS-CoV-2's extraordinary efficiency in gaining cellular access, crossing the epithelial\/endothelial barrier to spread along the vascular\/lymphatic endothelium, and evading antiviral\/antioxidant defences. An inflammation-driven \"oxidative storm\" alters the redox landscape, eliciting epithelial, endothelial, mitochondrial, metabolic, and immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Concomitantly reduced nitric oxide availability renders the sulfur-based redox circuitry vulnerable to oxidation, with eventual catastrophic failure in redox communication\/regulation. Host nutrient limitations are crucial determinants of resilience at the individual and population level. Future Directions: While inflicting considerable damage to health and well-being, COVID-19 may provide the ultimate testing ground to improve the diagnosis and treatment of redox-related stress diseases. \"Redox phenotyping\" of patients to characterize whole-body RSI status as the disease progresses may inform new therapeutic approaches to regain redox balance, reduce mortality in COVID-19 and other redox diseases, and provide opportunities to tackle Long-COVID.

Here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Here, we reviewed the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the processes of formation of oxidative stress and inflammation in viral and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors of the RAAS to penetrate human cells. The coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the RAAS.

METHODS: Phone-based surveys were completed with adult patients tested for COVID-19 during emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or outpatient visits at the Froedtert and Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network. Data were then matched to medical record data. Unadjusted and adjusted mixed effects linear models using random intercept were run for each outcome (physical health-related quality of life, mental health-related quality of life, perceived stress, and serious psychological distress) with time (baseline vs 3-month follow-up) as the primary independent variable. Individuals were treated as a random effect, with all covariates (age, sex, race\/ethnicity, payor, comorbidity count, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay) treated as fixed effects. RESULTS: 264 adults tested positive for COVID-19 and completed baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Of that number, 31.8% were hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 10.2% were admitted for any reason to the ICU. After adjustment, patients reported higher physical health-related quality of life at 3 months compared to baseline (0.63, 95% CI 0.15, 1.11) and decreased stress at 3 months compared to baseline (- 0.85, 95% CI - 1.33, - 0.37).

Inflammation and oxidative stress are mutually reinforcing each other, thus contributing to the systemic hyperinflammatory state and coagulopathy which are cardinal pathological mechanisms of severe stages. COVID-19 patients, like other critically ill patients e.g. with pneumonia, very often show severe deficiency of the antioxidant vitamin C. So far, it has not been investigated how long this deficiency lasts or whether patients with long COVID symptoms also suffer from deficiencies. A vitamin C deficit has serious pathological consequences because vitamin C is one of the most effective antioxidants, but also co-factor of many enzymatic processes that affect the immune and nervous system, blood circulation and energy metabolism. Because of its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, endothelial-restoring, and immunomodulatory effects the supportive intravenous (iv) use of supraphysiological doses has been investigated so far in 12 controlled or observational studies with altogether 1578 inpatients with COVID-19. In these studies an improved oxygenation, a decrease in inflammatory markers and a faster recovery were observed. In addition, early treatment with iv high dose vitamin C seems to reduce the risks of severe courses of the disease such as pneumonia and also mortality. Persistent inflammation, thrombosis and a dysregulated immune response (auto-immune phenomena and\/or persistent viral load) seem to be major contributors to Long-COVID. Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the development and progression of fatigue and neuro-psychiatric symptoms in various diseases by disrupting tissue (e.g. autoantibodies), blood flow (e.g. immune thrombosis) and neurotransmitter metabolism (e.g. excitotoxicity). In oncological diseases, other viral infections and autoimmune diseases, which are often associated with fatigue, cognitive disorders, pain and depression similar to Long-COVID, iv high dose vitamin C was shown to significantly relieve these symptoms. Supportive iv vitamin C in acute COVID-19 might therefore reduce the risk of severe courses and also the development of Long-COVID.","assigned_subjects1":"Stress | Hyper-Inflammation | COVID-19 | COVID | Vitamin C |Psychological Distress | Inflammation | |"},{"pmid":"35431403","title_e":"Marginal BH4 Deficiencies, iNOS, and Self-perpetuating Oxidative Stress in Post-acute Sequelae of Covid-19.","authors":"Villaume WA, ","abstract":"The treatment of post-acute sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC) has been informed primarily by symptomatic parallels with other chronic inflammatory syndromes. This manuscript takes a more systemic approach by examining how a marginal deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) resulting from mutations of the GCH1 (GTP cyclohydrolase 1) gene may result in the uncoupling of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) early in the initial response of the innate immune system to SARS-CoV-2. The resulting production of superoxide instead of nitric oxide leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of oxidative stress with the potential to impair numerous metabolic processes and damage multiple organ systems. This marginal deficiency of BH4 may be exhibited by 30% or more of the patient population that have heterozygous or homozygous mutations of GCH1. As the cycle of oxidative stress continues, there is less BH4 available for other metabolic needs such as 1) resisting increased ferroptosis with its damage to organs, and 2) regulating the deactivation of the hyperinflammatory state.

Additionally, some serious outcomes, such as heart attacks and even stroke, have been later reported in patients who had recovered. There are limited studies on how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects some molecular pathways, including oxidative stress and DNA damage. In this study, we aimed to evaluate DNA damage, using the alkaline comet assay, and its relationship with oxidative stress and immune response parameters in COVID-19-positive patients. Our results show that DNA damage, oxidative stress parameters and cytokine levels significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients when compared with healthy controls. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on DNA damage, oxidative stress and immune responses may be crucial in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is suggested that the illumination of these pathways will contribute to the development of clinical treatments and to reduce adverse effects in the future.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"36131852","title_e":"Psychological Distress and Post-COVID Sequelae in Postpartum Females after Clinically Stable COVID-19 Infections: A Single-Center Observational Study from India.","authors":"Bahadur A, Mundhra R, Sharma S, Ajmani M, Zaman R, Chaturvedi J, ","abstract":"Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the presence of any post-COVID physical and stress sequelae up to 3 months postpartum.

By emphasizing 'nonspecificity' he tried to underline that stress response is elicited my several factors, like nowadays in COVID-19, e.g., fear of infection, social isolation, death in family, loss of employment, etc. Thus, COVID-19 has been the largest new human stressor in the twenty-first century. Selye's studies in rats also revealed 3 stages of stress response: the short initial \"alarm reaction\" is followed by a longer \"stage of resistance\", associated with increased levels of corticosterone that is often terminated by a \"stage of exhaustion\", referring to an exhausted adrenal cortex when the secretion of glucocorticoids drops. Fast forward, that is exactly what has been documented in severe cases of infections caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus: in hospitalized COVID-19 patients initially the blood levels of cortisol not only have been elevated, but only those with high concentration of this natural anti-inflammatory corticosteroid survived vs. those who had low levels of cortisol, suggesting diminished adrenocortical functions. Furthermore, patients with very severe cases of COVID-19 who ended up in intensive care units had significantly low cortisol blood levels, compared to patients with equal severity of diseases due to other causes. Thus, these 'natural phenomena' in clinical medicine, unfortunately confirmed Selye's studies in experimental animals several decades ago. Still, the good news is that astute clinicians empirically recognized this and started to give potent synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone to severe COVD-19 patients and this beneficial effect of exogenous corticoids has been extensively confirmed in the scientific literature.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"37561435","title_e":"Long-COVID stress symptoms: Mental health, anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress.","authors":"Saltzman LY, Longo M, Hansel TC, ","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Currently, there is no single profile of mental health sequela in long-coronavirus disease (COVID) patients, impacting identification, treatment, and exacerbating stigma among this population. This article highlights the rationale for mental health professionals to consider a summary of mental health symptoms in long-COVID patients. METHOD: This article provides an overview of the existing literature regarding the health and mental health impact of long COVID on patients and proposes an approach to conceptualizing mental health symptoms in individuals living with long COVID. This article summarizes the health and mental health impacts of long COVID and underscores the limitations of the current approach to measuring and screening mental health symptoms in long-COVID patients. RESULTS: Long-COVID patients have reported new and worsening mental health symptoms; most frequently reported are depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and insomnia. The article concludes by proposing the notion of long-COVID stress symptoms and calls for mental health researchers to identify the unique and complex mental health profiles emerging among this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Though some long-COVID patients survived life-threatening illnesses and may, therefore, meet the formal criteria for PTSD, many will present with posttraumatic symptomology that mimics PTSD but may not arise from life-threatening medical trauma. A better understanding of the mental health burden of long-COVID stress symptoms is essential to providing efficient and effective mental health treatment, supporting physicians treating long-COVID patients, and enhancing access to and utilization of medical services.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are the major modulators of IPF that mediate myofibroblast differentiation and promote fibrotic remodeling of the lung. Cigarette smoke, asbestos fiber, drugs, and radiation are known to favor fibrotic remodeling of the lungs. Oxidative stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also leads to protein misfolding and promotes ER stress, which is predominant in IPF. This phenomenon further results in excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) aggregation, increasing oxidative stress. During protein folding in the ER, thiol groups on the cysteine residue are oxidized and disulfide bonds are formed, which leads to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product. With the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, multiple signaling cascades are initiated by the cell, collectively termed as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR also induces ROS production within the ER and mitochondria and promotes both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF) is 44.9%, along with an alarming increase in \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19) comorbidities. Fibrotic airway remodeling and declined lung function are the common endpoints of SARS-CoV-2 infection and IPF. Flavonoids are available in our dietary supplements and exhibit medicinal properties.

In endothelial cells, mitochondria regulate these inflammatory pathways via redox signaling, which is primarily achieved through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Excess mtROS causes oxidative stress that can initiate and exacerbate senescence, a state that promotes inflammation and chronic endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress can also activate feedback loops that perpetuate mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS overproduction, and inflammation. In this review, we provide an overview of phenotypes mediated by mtROS in endothelial cells - such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and senescence - as well as how these chronic states may be initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells. We also propose that SARS-CoV-2 activates mtROS-mediated feedback loops that cause long-term changes in host redox status and endothelial function, promoting cardiovascular disease and lung injury after recovery from COVID-19.

Interestingly, up to 50% of patients suffer from persistent exercise dyspnoea and a post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) after having overcome an acute COVID-19 infection. In the present study, we assessed the presence of coronary microvascular disease (CMD) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in post-COVID-19 patients still suffering from exercise dyspnoea and PVFS. N = 22 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, N = 16 patients with classic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and N = 17 healthy control patients without relevant cardiac disease underwent dedicated vasodilator-stress CMR studies on a 1.5-T MR scanner. The CMR protocol comprised cine and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging as well as velocity-encoded (VENC) phase-contrast imaging of the coronary sinus flow (CSF) at rest and during pharmacological stress (maximal vasodilation induced by 400 microg IV regadenoson). Using CSF measurements at rest and during stress, global myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was calculated. There was no difference in left ventricular ejection-fraction (LV-EF) between COVID-19 patients and controls (60% [57-63%] vs. 63% [60-66%], p = NS). There were only N = 4 COVID-19 patients (18%) showing a non-ischemic pattern of LGE. VENC-based flow measurements showed that CSF at rest was higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (1.78 ml\/min [1.19-2.23 ml\/min] vs. 1.14 ml\/min [0.91-1.32 ml\/min], p = 0.048). In contrast, CSF during stress was lower in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.33 ml\/min [2.76-4.20 ml\/min] vs. 5.32 ml\/min [3.66-5.52 ml\/min], p = 0.05). A significantly reduced MPR was calculated in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (2.73 [2.10-4.15-11] vs. 4.82 [3.70-6.68], p = 0.005). No significant differences regarding MPR were detected between COVID-19 patients and HCM patients. In post-COVID-19 patients with persistent exertional dyspnoea and PVFS, a significantly reduced MPR suggestive of CMD-similar to HCM patients-was observed in the present study. A reduction in MPR can be caused by preceding SARS-CoV-2-associated direct as well as secondary triggered mechanisms leading to diffuse CMD, and may explain ongoing symptoms of exercise dyspnoea and PVFS in some patients after COVID-19 infection.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"34744416","title_e":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder post-COVID-19: a case presentation.","authors":"Alkhamees AA, ","abstract":"Background: Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant changes that impacted because of it, people around the world have been left dealing with its consequences-fear of becoming ill and dying, fear of losing loved ones, uncertainty about the future, and imposed social isolation-several elements which could lead to psychological consequences.

Due to the novel antigenic properties of this virus, the world population could not develop immunity effectively and this led to the subsequent spread of COVID-19. This caused an unprecedented emergency situation with significant negative effects on health and well-being both on an individual and societal level. Apart from health, economic and social consequences, the impact of this pandemic on mental health is increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. The present review aimed to provide a comprehensive discussion of the possible neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, together with the related underlying molecular pathways. In addition, the present review focused on populations which are at a higher risk of developing psychiatric disturbances due to the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed possible routes of clinical management and therapeutics to minimize the burden associated with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, research findings exploring the prevalence of COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms across vulnerable groups, including children, adolescents and COVID-19 survivors are presented, with particular emphasis on those with severe disease who required hospitalization and\/or intensive care unit admission. Based on the available literature, the identification of potential determinants associated with PTSD across the different populations is underlined. Lessons learnt from the pandemics across the globe together with the ongoing research on COVID-19 and its impact on mental health, highlight the utmost importance for evidence-based, proactive and targeted interventions in high-risk groups aiming to mitigate the risks and manage vulnerabilities.","assigned_subjects1":"COVID-19 | traumatic stress disorder | | Stress Disorders, Traumatic"},{"pmid":"34345869","title_e":"Anxiety, depression, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms following COVID-19 infection at long-term follow-up.","authors":"Kyzar EJ, Purpura LJ, Shah J, Cantos A, Nordvig AS, Yin MT, ","abstract":"A developing finding from the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in COVID-19 survivors.

We examined left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular longitudinal strain in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and assessed the correlation with exercise capacity. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients with history of COVID-19 disease who had been referred to rest or stress echocardiography because of symptoms, mainly dyspnea and chest pain, were included in the study. These patients were compared to 106 patients with similar age, symptoms, and risk factor profile with no history of COVID-19 disease. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters, including strain imaging, were assessed. The patient's age was 48 +- 12 years. Twenty-two patients had undergone severe disease. There were no differences in the LV ejection fraction and diastolic function between the groups. However, LV and RV global and free wall strain were significantly lower (in absolute numbers) in patients who had recovered form COVID-19 infection (-20.41 +- 2.32 vs -19.39 +- 3.36, p = 0.001, -23.69 +- 3.44 vs -22.09 +- 4.20, p = 0.001 and -27.24 +- 4.7 vs -25.43 +- 4.93, p = 0.021, respectively). Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) < -20% was present in only 37% of post COVID-19 patients. Sixty-four patients performed exercise echocardiography. Patients with GLS < -20% had higher exercise capacity with higher peak metabolic equivalent and exercise time compared to patients with GLS >= -20% (12.6 +- 2 vs 10 +- 2.5 METss and 8:00 +- 2:08 vs 6:24 +- 2:03 min, p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients, who had recovered from COVID-19 infection, both LV and RV strain are significantly lower compared to control patients. The exercise capacity of these patients correlates with LV strain values. Rest and stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms after COVID-19 infection may identify patients that need further follow up to avoid long term complications of the disease. These preliminary results warrant further research, to test the natural history of these findings and the need and timing of treatment.","assigned_subjects1":"Myocardial Dysfunction | Patients | COVID-19 Disease | Myocardial abnormalities | COVID-19 | infection | LV | ventricular longitudinal | patients | COVID-19 | patients | COVID-19 | stress | dyspnea | chest pain | patients | patients | COVID-19 | patient | patients | LV | LV | patients | COVID-19 | infection | COVID-19 | patients | patients | Patients | patients | patients | COVID-19 | infection | LV | patients | patients | LV | stress | patients | COVID-19 | infection | patients |Cardiomyopathies | | | Infections | | Ventricular Fibrillation | Psychological Distress | Dyspnea | Chest Pain"},{"pmid":"34377750","title_e":"Dynamic functional network connectivity associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.","authors":"Fu Z, Tu Y, Calhoun VD, Zhang Y, Zhao Q, Chen J, Meng Q, Lu Z, Hu L, ","abstract":"Accumulating evidence shows that Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) survivors may encounter prolonged mental issues, especially post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS).

In contrast, time-varying characteristics of the dynamic functional networks may help reveal important brain abnormalities in COVID-19 survivors. To test this hypothesis, we assessed PTSS and collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospitals and matched controls. Results showed that COVID-19 survivors self-reported a significantly higher PTSS than controls. Tapping into the moment-to-moment variations of the fMRI data, we captured the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) states, and three discriminative reoccurring brain dFNC states were identified. First of all, COVID-19 survivors showed an increased occurrence of a dFNC state with heterogeneous patterns between sensorimotor and visual networks. More importantly, the occurrence rate of this state was significantly correlated with the severity of PTSS. Finally, COVID-19 survivors demonstrated decreased topological organizations in this dFNC state than controls, including the node strength, degree, and local efficiency of the supplementary motor area.

BACKGROUND: Studies have focused on persistent symptoms of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the medium term. Thus, long-term studies of nonhospitalised patients are urgently required. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: In 102 nonhospitalised COVID-19 patients, we collected symptoms at 3 months (baseline) and at 6-7 months (follow-up) from diagnosis (dyspnoea, fatigue\/muscle weakness and chest\/joint pain), HRQoL, psychological state, cognitive function, pulmonary and physical function. This study adhered to the STROBE statement. RESULTS: HRQoL was impaired in almost 60% of the sample and remained impaired 6-7 months. At 3 months, more than 60% had impaired physical function (fatigue\/muscle weakness and reduced leg and inspiratory muscle strength). About 40%-56% of the sample showed an altered psychological state (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety\/depression), cognitive function impairment and dyspnoea. At 6-7-months, only a slight improvement in dyspnoea and physical and cognitive function was observed, with a very high proportion of the sample (29%-55%) remained impaired. Impaired HRQoL at 6-7 months was predicted with 82.4% accuracy (86.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity) by the presence at 3 months of muscle fatigue\/muscle weakness (OR = 5.7 (1.8-18.1)), PTSD (OR = 6.0 (1.7-20.7)) and impaired HRQoL (OR = 11.7 (3.7-36.8)). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of nonhospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience an impaired HRQoL, cognitive and psychological function at long-term. HRQoL, PTSD and dyspnoea at 3 months can identify the majority of patients with COVID-19 who will have impaired quality of life at long-term.

Although various immune perturbations were present in Long COVID, low levels of cortisol were prominent and strikingly, depression and anxiety were increased. It has become clear that Long COVID features may be similar to those described in myalgic encephalomyelitis\/chronic fatigue syndrome, post-SARS sickness syndrome, and various chronic stress syndromes which have been linked to hypocortisolemia. Notably, lack of response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to hypocortisolemia shows a suppressed axis in Long COVID. We suggest that the inability of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to recover after the acute illness, perhaps due to protracted stress in predisposed individuals, may represent the pathogenetic basis of the Long COVID-associated clinical and immunological manifestations.","assigned_subjects1":"stress | hypocortisolemia | COVID | Psychological Distress | | "},{"pmid":"36201465","title_e":"Assessment of oxidative stress markers in elderly patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential prognostic implications in the medium and long term.","authors":"Vazquez-Agra N, Marques-Afonso AT, Cruces-Sande A, Novo-Veleiro I, Pose-Reino A, Mendez-Alvarez E, Soto-Otero R, Hermida-Ameijeiras A, ","abstract":"We aimed to evaluate the correlation of plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced thiols with morbidity, mortality and immune response during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1 and July 31, 2020, were included in a longitudinal study. Clinical assessments were conducted with online auto-questionnaires. PTSS were assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS). We screened for several putative factors associated with PTSS, including socio-demographic status, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, history of psychiatric disorder, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, and the home-to-hospital distance. Bivariate and multilinear regression analyses were performed to evaluate their association with PTSS. Results: 119 patients were evaluated 3 months after hospital discharge, and a subset of 94 were evaluated 6 months after discharge. The prevalence of PTSS was 31.9% after 3 months and 30.9% after 6 months. Symptoms of anxiety and depression and history of psychiatric disorder were independently associated with PTSS. Additionally, dissociative experiences during hospitalization (beta = 0.35; P < .001) and a longer home-to-hospital distance (beta = 0.07; P = .017) were specifically associated with PTSS 3 and 6 months after discharge, respectively. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 showed persistent high scores of PTSS up to 6 months after discharge from the hospital. In this specific pandemic setting, PTSS were associated with high rates of dissociative experiences during hospitalization and a longer home-to-hospital distance due to the saturation of health care facilities. These results can foster early identification and better prevention of PTSS after hospitalization for COVID-19.

Purpose: This study aimed to document the cross-sectional prevalence, characteristics and clinical correlates of anxiety and post-traumatic stress in a study of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19. Method: 75 participants recruited from a post-COVID-19 recovery program and the community were assessed for sociodemographic, medical, psychiatric, and neurocognitive symptoms and performance. The generalized anxiety questionnaire-7 (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire for DSM5 (PCL5) were utilized to measure anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Established cutoff scoring for the GAD-7 and algorithm-based scoring of the PCL5 were utilized to determine clinically significant anxiety symptoms and PTSD, respectively. Results: The cohort was 71% female, 36% ethnic minority, with the main age of 43.5 years, 80% employment, 40% with the prior psychiatric treatment history and 2\/3 seeking post-COVID care for PASC. Clinically significant anxiety symptoms were found in 31% and PTSD was found in 29% of the cohort. Nervousness and excessive worry were the most prominent anxiety symptoms, while changes in mood\/cognition and avoidance were most frequent in PTSD. There was a high degree of comorbidity between clinically significant anxiety symptoms, PTSD, depression and fatigue. In logistic regression, acute COVID illness severity, prior psychiatric history, and memory complaints (but not objective neuropsychological performance) predicted clinically significant anxiety symptoms and\/or PTSD. Conclusion: Clinically significant anxiety and PTSD are found in approximately 1 of 3 individuals after COVID-19 infection. They are highly comorbid with each other as well as with depression and fatigue. All patients seeking care for PASC should be screened for these neuropsychiatric complications. Symptoms of worry, nervousness, subjective changes in mood, and cognition as well as behavioral avoidance are particularly important targets of clinical intervention.","assigned_subjects1":""},{"pmid":"36741307","title_e":"Post-traumatic stress among COVID-19 survivors: A descriptive study of hospitalized first-wave survivors.","authors":"Rival G, Chalbet S, Dupont C, Brun P, Letranchant L, Reynaud C, Dureault A, Saison J, Jeannot M, Barbour S, Bacconnier M, Paulus V, Champagne H, Buiret G, ","abstract":"Introduction: The coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 1 induces a severe respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The aim of this study was to propose an innovative comprehensive intervention based on a hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation program for individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Methods: It was decided to evaluate two forms of hospital rehabilitation: traditional and one provided through virtual reality. Preliminary results are based on a group of 32 patients (20 female and 12 male), of average age 57.8 (4.92) years in the period of 3-6 months after the initial infection. Primary outcomes included analysis of lung function, exercise performance and stress level. A 3-week, high-intensity, five-times per week pulmonary rehabilitation program was designed to compare the effectiveness of a traditional form with a VR-led, novel form of therapy. Results: The analysis of the results showed a statistically significant improvement in both groups with regard to exercise performance expressed as 6MWT distance. Moreover, a statistically significant decrease in dyspnoea levels following the 6MWT was also noted in intergroup comparison, but the between-group comparison revealed non-statistically significant changes with low effect size. Regarding lung function, the analysis showed essentially normal lung function at baseline and a non-statistically significant improvement after the completion of the rehabilitation program. The analysis of the stress level showed a statistically significant improvement in both groups within the inter-group comparison, yet the between-group comparison of deltas values showed a non-significant difference with low effect size. Conclusion: A 3-weeks inpatients pulmonary rehabilitation program led to improvement of the exercise performance of people with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, but not lung function. Furthermore, the program was shown to reduce patients' stress levels. A comparison of the traditional form of rehabilitation to the novel form using VR, shows similar effectiveness in terms of exercise performance and stress levels.","assigned_subjects1":"COVID-19 |"},{"pmid":"36907459","title_e":"Stress levels, psychological symptoms, and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19: A cross-sectional study.","authors":"de Azevedo Cardoso T, Silva RH, Fernandes JL, Arent CO, Amboni G, Borba LA, Padilha APZ, Botelho MEM, Maciel AL, Barichello T, Morales R, Soares SJB, Bagatini MD, Dallagnol C, Brighenti ME, Ignácio ZM, Quevedo J, Ceretta LB, Réus GZ,","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although many studies have pointed out a possible relationship between COVID-19 and the presence of psychiatric disorders, the majority of the studies have significant limitations. This study investigates the influence of COVID-19 infection on mental health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included an age- and sex-matched sample of adult individuals positive (cases) or negative (controls) for COVID-19. We evaluated the presence of psychiatric conditions and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Findings showed greater severity of depressive symptoms, higher levels of stress, and greater CRP in cases. The severity of depressive and insomnia symptoms, as well as the CRP were more remarkable in individuals with moderate\/severe COVID-19. We found a positive correlation between stress and severity of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in individuals with or without COVID-19. There was a positive correlation between CRP levels and severity of depressive symptoms in cases and controls, and a positive correlation between CRP levels and the severity of anxiety symptoms and stress levels only in individuals with COVID-19. Individuals with COVID-19 and depression had greater CRP than those with COVID-19 without current major depressive disorder.

They may be associated with inflammatory processes due to cellular oxidative stress and an imbalanced antioxidant system. The ability of phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, such as Ginkgo biloba, to alleviate neurological complications and brain tissue damage has attracted strong ongoing interest in the neurotherapeutic management of long COVID. Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (EGb) contains several bioactive ingredients, e.g., bilobalide, quercetin, ginkgolides A-C, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and luteolin. They have various pharmacological and medicinal effects, including memory and cognitive improvement. Ginkgo biloba, through its anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, impacts cognitive function and other illness conditions like those in long COVID. While preclinical research on the antioxidant therapies for neuroprotection has shown promising results, clinical translation remains slow due to several challenges (e.g., low drug bioavailability, limited half-life, instability, restricted delivery to target tissues, and poor antioxidant capacity). This review emphasizes the advantages of nanotherapies using nanoparticle drug delivery approaches to overcome these challenges. Various experimental techniques shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the oxidative stress response in the nervous system and help comprehend the pathophysiology of the neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To develop novel therapeutic agents and drug delivery systems, several methods for mimicking oxidative stress conditions have been used (e.g., lipid peroxidation products, mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors, and models of ischemic brain damage). We hypothesize the beneficial effects of EGb in the neurotherapeutic management of long-term COVID-19 symptoms, evaluated using either in vitro cellular or in vivo animal models of oxidative stress.","assigned_subjects1":""}]
